# :volcano: Volcano Sort
The hottest sorting algorithm around!

### Disclaimer
This is a joke. This algorithm runs in O(n<sup>2</sup>). Please don't use this.

### Motivation
Our professor mentioned volcanoes when discussing sorting algorithms. I realized there wasn't a "Volcano Sort". There shouldn't be, but now there is.

### Methodology

### Future Development
None!
